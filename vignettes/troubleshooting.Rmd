## CLI Docker Compose

   1. Open a terminal and check your version of docker and docker-compose. docker must be >= 20.10 and docker-compose needs to be >= 1.29
        
        ```bash
         docker --version
         # Docker version 20.10.7, build 20.10.7-0ubuntu5~18.04.3
         ```
         
         ```bash
         docker-compose --version
         # Docker Compose version v2.12.1
         ```
        If they are not, please update them by

        ```bash
        sudo apt-get update
        ```

        ```bash
        sudo apt-get install docker
        ```
   2. [Download the compose yaml file by right clicking this link and 'saving as'](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CDCgov/MIRA/prod/docker-compose-git.yml) into your sequencing run top folder, ie `FLU_SC2_SEQUENCING`. You can also download this file on the command line by

        ```bash
        # Change your working directory to `FLU_SC2_SEQUENCING`
        cd ~/FLU_SC2_SEQUENCING
        ```

        ```bash
        # Download docker compose file
        wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CDCgov/MIRA/prod/docker-compose-git.yml
        ```

   3. Launch MIRA with docker compose:
        
        ```bash
        docker-compose up -d 
        ```

## WSL install error
From the Windows search bar, open `Turn Windows Features on or off` and make sure the following 4 features are checked off:
- Hyper-V
- Virtual Machine Platform
- Windows Hypervisor Platform
- Windows Subsystem for Linux


## Map network drive

**_Many computers have trouble with this step; the folders are not selectable during this step. First, make sure that an Ubuntu terminal is opened and then open the `File Explorer`. If "Ubuntu" is still not showing up in `File Explorer`, you can try to find the solution here: [https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/3996](https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/3996)._

1. Open <a href="./images/file_explorer.png" target="_blank">File Explorer</a>
    - _If you have a Windows 10 or 11 OS, WSL is likely automatically mapped and visible in the left hand sidebar as "Ubuntu"_
2. Right click <a href="./images/map_drive_1.png" target="_blank">This PC and click Map network drive</a>
3. Enter `\\wsl$` into Folder: <a href="./images/map_drive_2.png" target="_blank">and click Browse</a>
4. Click on `wsl$` to unfold directories, select `Ubuntu-18.04` <a href="./images/map_drive_3.png" target="_blank">and click OK</a> and then `Finish`. You should now see your WSL "drive" available in `File Explorer`:

## Docker CLI errors
- If you get an error related to starting Docker, run the following command, then try to run hello-world again

```bash
sudo service docker start
```
- If you get an error related to "Permission Denied" of docker.sock, run the following command, then try to run hello-world again

```bash
sudo chmod -755 /run/docker.sock
```

- If your hello-world container still is not showing, open the Ubuntu-22.04 command prompt and run:

```bash
docker run -d -p 80:80 docker/getting-started
```
