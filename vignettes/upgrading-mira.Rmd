## How to upgrade MIRA to the latest version

1. Open a terminal (Ubuntu if you installed WSL2 with this instructions, Terminal if you are using a Mac). `cd` to the folder with your sequence run data:
   
   ```bash
    cd ~/FLU_SC2_SEQUENCING
   ```

2. Download the installation script from the internet:
   
   ```bash
    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CDCgov/MIRA/prod/docker-compose-git.yml | sed "s%/path/to/data%$(pwd)/%g" > docker-compose.yml
   ```

   _if you get a permissions error here, first run `sudo rm docker-compose.yml` then try again_

3. Run a build command:

   ```bash
   sudo docker compose build
   ```

4. Run the install script with `sudo` and `docker-compose`:
   
   ```bash
    sudo docker-compose up -d
   ```
