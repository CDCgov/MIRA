MIRA runs inside Docker containers. Containers have all of the code and dependencies necessary to run MIRA and only have access to user defined folders or sockets on your computer.

1. Open a terminal (Ubuntu if you installed WSL2 with this instructions, Terminal if you are using a Mac). Create a folder to store your sequence run data and change to that directory:
   
   ```bash
    mkdir ~/MIRA_NGS
    ```

   ```bash
    cd ~/MIRA_NGS
   ```
2. Download the installation script from the internet:
   
   ```bash
    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CDCgov/MIRA/prod/docker-compose-git.yml | sed "s%/path/to/data%$(pwd)/%g" > docker-compose.yml
   ```

   ```bash
    sudo docker compose up -d
   ```


4. The download should begin and a lot of information will begin to appear in your terminal such as:
