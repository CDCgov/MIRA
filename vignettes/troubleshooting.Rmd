## CLI Docker Compose

   1. Open a terminal and check your version of docker and docker-compose. docker must be >= 20.10 and docker-compose needs to be >= 1.29
        
        ```bash
         docker --version
         # Docker version 20.10.7, build 20.10.7-0ubuntu5~18.04.3
         docker-compose --version
         # Docker Compose version v2.12.1
        ```
        If they are not, please update them by

        ```bash
         sudo apt-get update
         sudo apt-get install docker
        ```
   2. [Download the compose yaml file by right clicking this link and 'saving as'](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CDCgov/MIRA/prod/docker-compose-git.yml) into your sequencing run top folder, ie `FLU_SC2_SEQUENCING`. You can also download this file on the command line by

        ```bash
        # Change your working directory to `FLU_SC2_SEQUENCING`
        cd ~/FLU_SC2_SEQUENCING
        # Download docker compose file
        wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CDCgov/MIRA/prod/docker-compose-git.yml
        ```

   3. Launch MIRA with docker compose:
        ```bash
        docker-compose up -d 
        ```
