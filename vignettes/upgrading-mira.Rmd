## How to upgrade MIRA to the latest version

1. Open a terminal (Ubuntu if you installed WSL2 with this instructions, Terminal if you are using a Mac). `cd` to the folder with your sequence run data:
   
   ```bash
    cd ~/FLU_SC2_SEQUENCING
   ```
2. Remove older MIRA versions (or iSpy or IRMA-spy if that's what you had installed)

   ```bash
   sudo docker rm -f mira spyne irma dais
   ```

3. Download the installation script from the internet:
   
   ```bash
    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CDCgov/MIRA/prod/docker-compose-git.yml | sed "s%/path/to/data%$(pwd)/%g" > docker-compose.yml
   ```

   _if you get a permissions error here, first run `sudo rm docker-compose.yml` then try again_

4. After you ensure that your Docker Desktop application is open, run a build command in Ubuntu:

   ```bash
   sudo docker compose build
   ```

5. Run the install script with `sudo` and `docker compose`:
   
   ```bash
    sudo docker compose up -d
   ```
