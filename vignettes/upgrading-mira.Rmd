## How to upgrade MIRA to the lastest version

   
### Upgrading MIRA with four containers (version 1.1.4) to MIRA single container (version 2.0.0)
   
1. Open a terminal (Ubuntu if you installed WSL2 with this instructions, Terminal if you are using a Mac). `cd` to the folder with your sequence run data:
   
   ```bash
    cd ~/FLU_SC2_SEQUENCING
   ```

2. Remove current running MIRA containers:

   ```bash
    docker rm -f mira spyne irma dais
   ```

3. Remove older MIRA image versions (or iSpy or IRMA-spy if that's what you had installed)

   ```bash
    sudo docker rmi -f $(docker images | grep -e irma -e dais -e mira -e spyne | tr -s " " | cut -f3 -d" ")
   ```

4. Download the installation script from the internet:
   
   ```bash
    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CDCgov/MIRA/prod/docker-compose-cdcgov.yml | sed "s%/path/to/data%$(pwd)/%g" > docker-compose.yml
   ```

   _if you get a permissions error here, first run `sudo rm docker-compose.yml` then try again_

5. After you ensure that your Docker Desktop application is open, run the install script with `sudo` and `docker compose`:
   
   ```bash
    sudo docker compose up -d
   ```
