
## Running iSpy with docker-compose

The iSpy's dashboard relies on four Docker containers to run its genome assembly and curation: **IRMA**, **DAIS-Ribosome**, **spyne**, and **iSpy**. Presently, the IRMA and DAIS-Ribosome docker images are stored in **AWSâ€™s EC**, and the spyne and iSpy docker images are stored in **Quay.io's repository**. These images can be pulled down and built into runnable containers with the ```docker pull``` and ```docker run``` commands.

Instead of pulling down each image one by one and run its container, we can utilize **docker-compose** to pull all the images down at once, build its containers, and configure them to communicate to each other. All these tasks can be accomplished using a docker-compose.yml file.

There are two versions of the docker-compose.yml files:

- [Development version](#build-development-version-of-ispy) for continuous integration of the application
- [Production version](#build-production-version-of-ispy) for deployment of the application

## Software requirements

- Docker version >= 20.10,
- Git version >= 2.21
- Docker-compose version >= 1.29

## Build development version of iSpy

This version allows you to mount the code base that is needed to develop the `iSpy` dashboard and `spyne` pipeline. Any updates or changes to the code will automatically reflects the changes inside their Docker containers. This allows continuous integration (CI) of the application.

### (1) Clone spyne respitory

```bash
git clone https://git.biotech.cdc.gov/nbx0/spyne.git
``` 

### (2) Clone iSpy respitory

```bash
git clone https://git.biotech.cdc.gov/nbx0/iSpy.git
``` 

### (3) Clone irma-spy-testdata respitory

```bash
git clone https://git.biotech.cdc.gov/nbx0/irma-spy-testdata.git
```

### (4) Extract test data for running iSpy and spyne

- CD to `irma-spy-testdata` folder where `data.tar.gz` file is stored and extract "runs" from the tar archive.

```bash
[ $( which pigz) ] &&\
    time tar --use-compress-program="pigz -p$(nproc)" -xf data.tar.gz ||\
    tar -xf data.tar.gz
```

### (5) CD to `iSpy` folder where `docker-compose-quay-dev.yml` is stored and edit the yaml file to link the data inputs and code base to appropriate containers

- Mount data directory to **/data** directory inside of all containers: change **/path/to/data** to your **irma-spy-testdata** directory
- Mount code base of **spyne** to **/spyne** directory inside the **spyne** container: change **/path/to/spyne** to your **spyne** directory
- Mount code base of **iSpy** to **/iSpy** directory inside the **ispy** container: change **/path/to/iSpy** to your **iSpy** directory

```bash
version: "3.9"

x-dais-version:
  &dais-version 
  public.ecr.aws/n3z8t4o2/dais-ribosome:1.2.1

x-irma-version:
  &irma-version 
  public.ecr.aws/n3z8t4o2/irma:1.0.2p3

x-spyne-version:
  &spyne-version 
  quay.io/nbx0_cdc/spyne:v1.1.0

x-ispy-version:
  &ispy-version 
  quay.io/nbx0_cdc/ispy:v1.1.0

x-data-volumes:
  &data-volume
  type: bind
  source: /path/to/data
  target: /data

x-docker-volumes:
  &docker-socket
  type: bind
  source: /var/run/docker.sock 
  target: /var/run/docker.sock 

x-spyne-volumes:
  &spyne-code
  type: bind
  source: /path/to/spyne
  target: /spyne 

x-ispy-volumes:
  &ispy-code
  type: bind
  source: /path/to/iSpy
  target: /iSpy
```

### (6) Start all services listed in the docker-compose.yml file

```bash
docker-compose up -d 
```

**-d**: run the containers in detached mode <br>

For more information about the docker-compose syntax, see [docker-compose up reference](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/compose_up/)

### (7) To check if the services are started sucessfully

```bash
docker-compose ps

```

### (8) Access the `iSpy` dashboard on the host network

You can visit the local host using your preferred web browser, type in http://localhost:8010, and check if the dashboard is indeed hosted there.


## Build production version of iSpy

This version **ONLY** allows you to mount the data files that are needed to run **IRMA**, **DAIS-Ribosome**, **spyne**, and **iSpy** containers. In other words, you do not have access to their code base but is using their latest containerized version of the code.


### (1) Clone irma-spy-testdata respitory

```bash
git clone https://git.biotech.cdc.gov/nbx0/irma-spy-testdata.git
```

### (2) Extract test data for running iSpy

- CD to `irma-spy-testdata` folder where `data.tar.gz` file is stored and extract "runs" from the tar archive.

```bash
[ $( which pigz) ] &&\
    time tar --use-compress-program="pigz -p$(nproc)" -xf data.tar.gz ||\
    tar -xf data.tar.gz
```

### (3) CD to `iSpy` folder where `docker-compose-quay.yml` is stored and edit the yaml file to link the data inputs to appropriate containers

- Mount data directory to `/data` directory inside of all containers: change `/path/to/data` to your `irma-spy-testdata` directory

```bash
version: "3.9"

x-dais-version:
  &dais-version 
  public.ecr.aws/n3z8t4o2/dais-ribosome:1.2.1

x-irma-version:
  &irma-version 
  public.ecr.aws/n3z8t4o2/irma:1.0.2p3

x-spyne-version:
  &spyne-version 
  quay.io/nbx0_cdc/spyne:v1.1.0

x-ispy-version:
  &ispy-version 
  quay.io/nbx0_cdc/ispy:v1.1.0

x-data-volumes:
  &data-volume
  type: bind
  source: /path/to/data
  target: /data

x-docker-volumes:
  &docker-socket
  type: bind
  source: /var/run/docker.sock 
  target: /var/run/docker.sock 
```

### (4) Start all services listed in the docker-compose.yml file

```bash
docker-compose up -d 
```

**-d**: run the containers in detached mode <br>

For more information about the docker-compose syntax, see [docker-compose up reference](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/compose_up/)

### (5) To check if the services are started sucessfully

```bash
docker-compose ps

```

### (6) Access the `iSpy` dashboard on the host network

You can visit the local host using your preferred web browser, type in http://localhost:8020, and check if the dashboard is indeed hosted there.

**NOTE:** Here we are publishing the `iSpy` dashboard on port **8020** on the host machine. This port is different from the **development** version which was previously launched on port **8010**.
