Assembled genomes undergo two kinds of quality control. First, at the IRMA level, reads are filtered according to length and median quality.
During the many rounds of reference editing and refinement, indels and variants must meet additional thresholds to be incorporated.
When consensus is called, base frequency, quality, and depth are considered before finalizing the sequence.

Second, consensus sequences undergo additional genome-level QC to ensure completeness and suitable confidence.
