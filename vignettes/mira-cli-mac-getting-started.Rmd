## [Install Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
Docker allows you to run software inside an isolated "container image" on your computer with all of that application's needed dependencies. Make sure to install the version for your operating system.

## MIRA Installation

- Open Docker Desktop, and once it is running:

Open Settings -> Features in development -> Experimental Features:

- Ensure "Access Experimental Features" and "Enable backround SBOM Indexing" are both checked on

Next, in __Beta Features__, enable "Use Rosetta for x86/amd66 emulation on Apple Silicon". This will help MIRA run faster and remain more stable


Save these settings by clicking "Apply & restart"
